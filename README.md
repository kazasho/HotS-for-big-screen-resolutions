# Heroes of the Storm enable big screen resolutions

The script works on Windows and MacOS.
It must be run by the user account on the machine that will execute the game.

## First time setup

1. Edit "resolution_fix.py"
2. Change the values under "User defined variables" to you liking
3. Run "resolution_fix.py"

After you have played the game or the battle.net client have scanned your files, a update button will appear instead of the "Play" button. After "Updating", the screen resolution will be reset.
Just run the script again when you have the "Play" button in the battle.net client, and then press "Play" to enjoy your full screen resolution in the game yet again :)
